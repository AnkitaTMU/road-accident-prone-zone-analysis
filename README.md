# Road Accident Prone Zone Analysis
(Repo for Major research project at TMU focussed on Road Accident-prone zone analysis)

Road traffic accidents are a critical issue worldwide, causing significant fatalities,
injuries, and economic losses. This study aims to analyze traffic accident data
comprehensively, focusing on identifying patterns and factors that contribute to
accident severity. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), the study evaluates how
variables such as time, weather conditions, road types, and geographic locations
influence accident occurrences. The findings from this analysis are expected to inform
better road safety policies and interventions, ultimately contributing to a reduction in
traffic accidents and their severity.

The aim of this study is to develop and compare machine learning models for
identifying and ranking accident-prone zones using historical traffic accident data. The
study seeks to leverage various features related to accident locations, circumstances,
and environmental factors to predict areas with higher accident risks.
